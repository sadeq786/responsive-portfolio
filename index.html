                Hello. This is Shaikh Rahman. I have a background in Electrical Engineering. I've lived in many different places. I'm really
                interested in diving into the world of software development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coming from a hardware technician background, I am used to constantly troubleshooting things 
                all day long. I've been utilizing the process of elimination and deductive reasoning to make logical 
                conclusions which I believe will come in handy for me because I find drbugging code absolutely frustrating. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am loving web development so far. Its all so exciting when everything works and figuring things out gives me an adrenaline
                rush. I'm counting all my small victories.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm learning to first become a JavaScript developer. The skills I'm picking up first are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.I finally
                understood the basics of using Git and GitHub, something that has been bothering me for a long time.
